      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">First Enlightenment: Awareness</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Buddha: you are the wave, not separate from the ocean. Eastern traditions discovered that consciousness itself is the ground, that the separation between observer and observed is illusion. Meditation practices trained awareness. The goal: see clearly, accept what is.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            <strong>Mode:</strong> The Investor. Observing patterns, reading situations, knowing when not to act. The shadow: paralysis, drift, watching life happen without participating.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">Second Enlightenment: Agency</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Descartes: I think, therefore I am. The Western turn split mind from world, subject from object. This separation was productive. It created science, engineering, the Enlightenment, modernity. We learned to master reality through understanding.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            <strong>Mode:</strong> The Engineer. Building, optimizing, doing. The shadow: cannot question premises, optimizes metrics while missing meaning, treats humans like variables in an equation.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">Third Enlightenment: Participation</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Integration: using Second Enlightenment tools for First Enlightenment awareness. Not choosing between ancient wisdom and modern capability. Holding both.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            <strong>Mode:</strong> The Student. Learning continuously, staying curious, acting while remaining open to revision. The shadow: using "learning" as an excuse for non-commitment.

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">The Formula</h2>

      <div class="bg-oat-100 p-8 mb-8">
        <p class="text-xl text-center text-ink">
          <span class="italic">Eastern acceptance</span> + <span class="italic">Western agency</span> = <strong>Emergent participation</strong>
        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Acceptance without agency is resignation. Agency without acceptance is violence against reality. The synthesis: participating in the world as it actually is, with full awareness, using all the tools available, holding outcomes loosely.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        This isn't passive. It's the hardest thing there is. Maintaining a rising spirit even when circumstances are difficult. Choosing to find the water beautiful even as it soaks you. The Sikh tradition calls this <em>Chardi Kala</em> — agentic hope.

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Why Now</h2>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        We built machines that think. Or something like thinking. The Second Enlightenment project reached a strange completion: the tools we built to master reality can now build tools themselves.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        This creates a problem for people who identified with being "the smart one" — the engineer, the analyst, the person who optimized their way to success. If intelligence can be automated, what's left?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The answer isn't to reject the machines. It's to use them for something older: understanding ourselves, clarifying what actually matters, extending our capacity without replacing our judgment.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        AI doesn't teach us anything new. It reflects what we already knew. The question is whether we have the awareness to see what it shows us.

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">The Body Knows</h2>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The Third Enlightenment isn't primarily intellectual. The body often arrives before the mind can articulate.
      </p>

      <blockquote class="border-l-4 border-sage-400 pl-6 my-8 italic text-ink-light">
        "Don't try to open. Just stop closing."
      </blockquote>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        A yoga instructor said this during camel pose — spine arching backward, heart exposed to the ceiling. The words landed somewhere below the brain. In the sternum, maybe. In the place where I'd been gripping without knowing I was gripping.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Stop trying to open feels like straining, like effort, like the Western imperative to achieve and improve. Stop closing feels like releasing what was already clenched. The pose didn't change. But I did.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        This is the work: noticing where you're already clenched. Noticing what the body already knows. Using the tools without becoming the tools.
      </p>

  <section class="container-zen section-zen border-t border-oat-300">

      <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">For Organizations</h2>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Organizations face the same choice individuals do. They can double down on Second Enlightenment approaches — more metrics, more optimization, more control. Or they can hold the paradox: using intelligence tools while remaining awake to what the tools can't measure.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The fastest thing you can measure is rarely the thing that matters most. Transaction speed, quarterly earnings, engagement metrics — these operate at one temporal frequency. Purpose, strategy, culture — these operate at another. Confusing the two is how organizations lose their way.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        Intelligence transformation isn't adopting AI. It's learning to use AI while staying connected to what you're actually trying to do. The means should serve the ends. The tools should serve the purpose.
      </p>
