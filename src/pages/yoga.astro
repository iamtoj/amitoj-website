        Movement as meditation. Practice as inquiry.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        Yoga is a technology for human development—one that predates
        the digital age by millennia. In a world increasingly mediated by screens
        and algorithms, embodied practice offers a counterweight: a way to stay
        grounded while everything else accelerates.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Practice</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        I've practiced for over a decade, studying in the vinyasa tradition with an
        emphasis on alignment and breath. What began as physical exercise became something
        deeper: a laboratory for understanding attention, effort, and release.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        The lessons transfer. How you meet difficulty on the mat—whether you push through,
        back off, or find the middle way—reveals how you meet difficulty everywhere.
        Physical practice supports cognitive and emotional clarity by training the nervous
        system to move between states with intention.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Third Enlightenment Connection</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Contemplative practice is not separate from technological transformation.
        The First Enlightenment was Gautama Buddha's: nondualism, awareness as key. The Second followed the Renaissance:
        Descartes, the scientific revolution, unlocking our agency to act. The Third integrates these — using
        Second Enlightenment tools for First Enlightenment awareness. Yoga is part of that integration.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        As AI systems take over more cognitive labor, the distinctly human capacities
        become more valuable: presence, judgment, creativity, relationship. These are
        trained not by thinking harder but by practicing differently. The body knows
        things the mind doesn't. Contemplative technologies like yoga cultivate exactly
        what the algorithmic world leaves out.
