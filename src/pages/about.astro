      <p class="text-lg text-ink-light mb-6">
        I work at the intersection of technology and human flourishing,
        helping people navigate transformation with clarity and purpose.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        I'm a writer, organizational theorist, and yoga practitioner based in New York.
        I think about how humans and systems navigate complexity together—how we make decisions
        under uncertainty, how organizations evolve, and how AI is reshaping what's possible.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Third Enlightenment</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The First Enlightenment brought scientific reason. The Second brought digital connection.
        The Third integrates artificial intelligence with contemplative practice,
        creating new possibilities for wisdom, creativity, and human development.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        I help people navigate the intersection of AI and human development.
        This means working with individuals on how to think alongside AI systems,
        and with organizations on how to redesign work for an age of intelligent machines.
        The approach draws on organizational theory, contemplative practice, and hands-on
        experience building with these technologies.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        Engagements range from individual coaching to organizational consulting to speaking.
        I typically work with knowledge workers, executives, and teams grappling with
        how AI changes what they do and who they become.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Background</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        My path here has been nonlinear. I've worked in strategy consulting, academic research,
        and technology—always drawn to the question of how systems work and how they change.
        The common thread is integration: bringing together ideas that illuminate more
        together than apart.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        I've practiced yoga for over a decade. What began as physical practice evolved into
        a contemplative discipline that shapes how I think. The relationship between body and mind,
        between action and awareness, informs everything else I do.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        Writing is how I think. I explore organizational theory, technology, and human development—
        trying to make sense of complexity by putting it into words. The process of writing
        is itself a form of inquiry.

        or the emerging AI landscape, I'd welcome the conversation.
