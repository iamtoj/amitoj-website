      <div class="accent-line mb-8"></div>

      <p class="text-lg text-ink-light mb-6">
        I spent a decade in institutional investing — GIC, private equity, hedge funds, venture capital — learning how capital allocates attention and shapes outcomes. I co-founded an investment fund. I built models. I optimized.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Then I started asking different questions.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The thread connecting my work now: how do we make better decisions when the world changes faster than our frameworks? How do we use technology to extend human capacity rather than replace human judgment? What does wisdom look like in an age of artificial intelligence?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        I write, teach yoga, and consult on strategy. The combination sounds strange until you realize they share a root: helping people see their situation more accurately and respond more effectively.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Third Enlightenment</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The First Enlightenment brought scientific reason. The Second brought digital connection.
        The Third integrates artificial intelligence with contemplative practice,
        creating new possibilities for wisdom, creativity, and human development.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Most AI conversations focus on capability: what can we build? I focus on wisdom: what should we build, and how do we remain human while building it?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The specific problems I help with:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-ink-light mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Strategic clarity in uncertainty.</strong> When your industry is changing faster than your planning cycles, you need frameworks that accommodate unknowns rather than pretend they don't exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Human-AI collaboration.</strong> Not "how do we use AI tools" but "how do we partner with AI systems" — a different question that requires different thinking about agency, judgment, and value.</li>
        <li><strong>Personal navigation.</strong> Executives and creators facing transitions: career shifts, identity questions, the gap between achievement and meaning.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        I work with founders, executives, and investors — people who need to make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information. The engagements vary: strategic advising, workshops on AI integration, individual coaching. What they share is a focus on how you think, not just what you do.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Background</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        <strong>The professional path:</strong> Engineering undergraduate, Wharton MBA, then fifteen years in institutional capital. I worked at GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund), in private equity, and in venture capital. I helped start an institutional hedge fund, where I was a partner. I learned how professional investors think — the frameworks, the blind spots, the ways capital shapes attention.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        I left because I realized I was becoming a very expensive calculator. The skills were real, but the questions had become small.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        <strong>The yoga practice:</strong> I've practiced for over a decade and teach at the Harvard Business School gym. Yoga isn't a hobby bolted onto my "real" work — it's a laboratory for the same questions. How do you pay attention? How do you stay present when things get uncomfortable? How do you distinguish between what you can control and what you cannot?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The contemplative traditions have spent millennia developing technologies of attention. The fact that we call them "spiritual" rather than "cognitive" says more about our categories than about what they actually are.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        <strong>The writing:</strong> I write about the Third Enlightenment — the integration of artificial intelligence with contemplative wisdom. The newsletter explores questions that don't fit neatly into either "tech" or "wellness" categories: What does self-knowledge look like when AI can analyze us better than we can? What is creativity when machines can generate? What is wisdom when knowledge is infinite and free?
