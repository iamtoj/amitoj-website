        The thread: how do we make better decisions when the world changes faster than our frameworks? How do we use intelligence — human and artificial — to extend capacity rather than replace judgment?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        I write, teach yoga, and advise on intelligence transformations. The combination shares a root: helping people see their situation more accurately and respond more effectively.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Third Enlightenment</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The First Enlightenment was the Buddha's: nondualism, awareness as key.
        The Second followed the Renaissance: Descartes, the scientific revolution, unlocking our agency to act—but separating us from the world.
        The Third is the integration: using Second Enlightenment tools for First Enlightenment awareness.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        Each transition changed not just what we could do, but who we could become.
        We are in the Third now. The question is whether we navigate it wisely.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Intelligence Transformation</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        What if any company — scaled enterprise or corner shop — had access to a thousand brilliant interns? A million? That's the promise of intelligence transformation. Not digital transformation (we did that). Not AI adoption (too narrow). The fundamental restructuring of how organizations think.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        I know what makes good business because I spent nearly 15 years advising and investing in startups and public companies alike. The patterns are consistent. The opportunity now is to make those patterns accessible to organizations that could never afford the talent to execute them.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The specific problems I help with:
      </p>

      <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-ink-light mb-6 space-y-2">
        <li><strong>Intelligence architecture.</strong> How to structure AI capabilities so they amplify human judgment rather than replace it. Not "which tools" but "which workflows."</li>
        <li><strong>Strategic clarity in uncertainty.</strong> When your industry changes faster than your planning cycles, you need frameworks that accommodate unknowns rather than pretend they don't exist.</li>
        <li><strong>Knowledge systems.</strong> Building the infrastructure that lets organizations capture, process, and act on what they know — the same systems I build for institutional investors.</li>
      </ul>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        I work with founders, executives, and investors — people who need to make high-stakes decisions with incomplete information.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Executive Coaching</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        A different model: one conversation to see if we're a fit. If we are, commit to twelve sessions spread across your lifetime.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        The first six to eight sessions do the primary work — understanding your patterns, clarifying your direction, building your capacity. The remaining sessions are banked for later. When you hit a transition, a crisis, or a question that needs outside perspective, they're there.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        Pay only if you get value.

    <h2 class="text-2xl mb-8">Background</h2>

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        <strong>Building:</strong> Wharton and M&T undergrad, then fifteen years building in institutional capital. GIC (Singapore's sovereign wealth fund), private equity, venture capital. Built and ran research for a public equity and venture capital fund. Learned how professional investors think — the frameworks, the blind spots, the ways capital shapes attention.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        <strong>Research:</strong> Harvard Business PhD student. My research examines how organizations allocate attention and find direction — "gilded shelter" (when resources hide decay), attention allocation in complex environments, and how groups determine the right direction when the path isn't clear.
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-6">
        <strong>Teaching:</strong> Yoga instructor at the HBS Gym. Yoga is a laboratory for the same questions I study academically. How do you pay attention? How do you stay present when things get uncomfortable? How do you distinguish what you can control from what you cannot?
      </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light">
        <strong>Writing:</strong> The Third Enlightenment newsletter explores questions that don't fit neatly into "tech" or "wellness" categories: What does self-knowledge look like when AI can analyze us better than we can? What is creativity when machines can generate? What is wisdom when knowledge is infinite and free?
