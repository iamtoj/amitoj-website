      <!-- WHY I RECOMMEND THIS -->

        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">Why I Recommend This</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Most ethical training focuses on the moment of decision: trolley problems, trade-offs, the dramatic instant of choice. Murdoch offers something different. Moral life, she argues, is mostly about the slow, patient work of attention that determines what we can see when a choice arrives.</p>
          <p>One sentence from this book has stayed with me: "I can only choose within the world I can see." If vision is clouded by fantasy, ego, or inattention, the right option may never even appear. The work isn't in choosing—it's in learning to see clearly. This is ethics as a practice of attention, not a calculus of outcomes.</p>

      <!-- THE BOOK -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">The Book</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Murdoch's radical claim: moral life is about vision, not choice. Against the prevailing philosophy of her time, which located morality in public action and discrete moments of decision, she argues that "I can only choose within the world I can see." Our perception is shaped by accumulated practices of attention long before we face any choice.</p>
          <p>The Good, for Murdoch, is not projection or construction but transcendent reality that functions like Plato's sun: not directly visible, but the source of light by which all else is seen. The path toward it requires "unselfing," the disciplined reduction of ego's distortions.</p>
