        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">Why I Recommend This</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>There's a question that runs through much of my research: why do frameworks struggle when they meet reality? Strategy papers, organizational designs, governance proposals—they look complete on paper, then encounter cases their authors never imagined.</p>
          <p>Daston offers vocabulary for this puzzle. She distinguishes <em>thick rules</em> (loaded with caveats, examples, room for judgment) from <em>thin rules</em> (mechanical, context-free, aspiring to cover everything). Her insight is historical: for most of Western history, people understood that rules couldn't anticipate every situation. Discretion was the feature, not the bug. Somewhere along the way, we forgot.</p>

      <!-- THE BOOK -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">The Book</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Daston traces 2,500 years of Western rule-making through three persistent forms: rules as algorithms (procedures to execute), rules as laws (commands to obey), and rules as models (exemplars to imitate). The last form—paradigms requiring interpretation—dominated until the Enlightenment but has largely been forgotten.</p>
          <p>Her central argument: the shift from thick to thin rules reflects a transformation in what we consider rational. Cold War thinkers elevated the algorithm to the ideal form of reasoning. But the ancient problem remains unsolved—no universal can anticipate every case it will encounter.</p>

          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-sage-400 pl-6">
            <p class="text-lg italic mb-2">"Even if rule and particular clearly match, they almost never align perfectly. Tailoring and tweaking will be necessary to smooth over the gap between universal and particular."</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-ink-muted">Entire specialties—equity, casuistry, case law—grew in this gap.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-sage-400 pl-6">
            <p class="text-lg italic mb-2">"An algorithm would then be seen not as the perfection of a rule, but as a pathological case of a rule."</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-ink-muted">The recipe-algorithm comparison inverts the usual hierarchy.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-sage-400 pl-6">
            <p class="text-lg italic mb-2">"By driving the exercise of discretion underground, rules-as-algorithms blow up the bridges that connected universals to particulars."</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-ink-muted">We eliminated judgment from rule-following, then wondered why our systems became rigid.</p>
          </blockquote>
          <blockquote class="border-l-2 border-sage-400 pl-6">
            <p class="text-lg italic mb-2">"Thick rules create a flexible order out of a disorderly world, but thin rules need an order that already exists in order to function at all."</p>
            <p class="text-sm text-ink-muted">Thin rules don't impose order—they presuppose it.</p>
