      <!-- WHY I RECOMMEND THIS -->

        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">Why I Recommend This</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>A Palestinian literary critic and an Israeli conductor meet in a London hotel lobby. What could have been a single awkward conversation became one of the most generative intellectual friendships of the past half-century.</p>
          <p>Said and Barenboim founded an orchestra of young Arab and Israeli musicians and spent a decade in conversation. This book captures those dialogues—about music, performance, Wagner's anti-Semitism, and what art can accomplish that politics cannot. What draws me back is their insistence that understanding does not require agreement. You can hold your position while genuinely engaging with someone who opposes it.</p>

      <!-- THE BOOK -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">The Book</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Emerged from public conversations at Carnegie Hall and private dialogues over a decade. Said (the author of <em>Orientalism</em>) and Barenboim (conductor, pianist, citizen of four countries including both Israel and Palestine) talk about music, performance, Wagner's anti-Semitism, and what art can do that politics cannot.</p>
          <p>The core thesis: music creates understanding across seemingly impossible divides—not by erasing difference, but by making shared practice possible. In 1999, they founded the West-Eastern Divan Orchestra, bringing together young Israeli and Arab musicians. The orchestra still performs.</p>

            <p class="text-lg italic mb-2">"The Divan was conceived as a project against ignorance... to understand what the other thinks and feels, without necessarily agreeing with it."</p>
