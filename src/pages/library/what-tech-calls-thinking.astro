      <!-- WHY I RECOMMEND THIS -->

        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">Why I Recommend This</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Silicon Valley's "revolutionary ideas" often turn out to be recycled philosophy dressed in hoodies. Daub, a Stanford literature professor with a front-row seat to tech culture, traces seven keywords—disruption, genius, failure, and others—back to their intellectual origins.</p>
          <p>What makes this valuable: by claiming every challenge is unprecedented, tech sometimes evades the analytical tools society has developed for similar problems. Daub shows what gets lost in translation when Girard's complex theology becomes "people copy each other" or Schumpeter's ambivalent analysis becomes "disruption is good." The book isn't anti-technology—it's pro-clarity about where ideas actually come from.</p>

      <!-- THE BOOK -->
      <section class="mb-12">
        <h2 class="text-sm text-ink-muted uppercase tracking-wider mb-4">The Book</h2>
        <div class="prose prose-lg">
          <p>Silicon Valley's "revolutionary ideas" are recycled philosophy dressed in hoodies. Daub, a Stanford literature professor with a front-row seat to tech culture, traces seven keywords—dropping out, content, genius, communication, desire, disruption, failure—back to their intellectual origins.</p>
          <p>The core argument: by claiming every challenge is unprecedented, tech evades the analytical tools society has developed for similar problems. Uber isn't ride-sharing innovation—it's an unlicensed taxi service. Facebook isn't a platform—it's a publisher with liability shields. The language is smokescreen.</p>
