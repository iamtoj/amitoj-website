      <div class="prose prose-lg">
        <p>Every organization has a hidden architecture that shapes everything it does. Not the org chart. Not the mission statement. Something more fundamental: the set of things everyone takes for granted.</p>

        <p>What counts as a problem worth solving? What evidence matters? What success looks like? These questions get answered before anyone sits down to make a decision. The answers are baked into job descriptions, reporting structures, budgeting processes, and the vocabulary people use in meetings. They're the premises that make organizational life possible.</p>

        <p>This essay is about those premises, and about a simple but consequential fact: attention is scarce, and organizations are machines for allocating it.</p>

        <h2>The Attention Problem</h2>

        <p>Organizations face a problem that sounds trivial but isn't: there's always more to notice than anyone can process.</p>

        <p>A hospital could track patient outcomes, infection rates, readmission frequencies, cost per patient, bed utilization, staff satisfaction, community health metrics, research output, and dozens of other indicators. Which ones matter? The answer isn't obvious. More importantly, the answer shapes everything else. An organization that tracks cost per patient will make different decisions than one that tracks community health impact, even if both claim to be pursuing "quality healthcare."</p>

        <p>This is the attention problem. Before you can optimize anything, you have to decide what's worth optimizing. Before you can gather relevant information, you have to decide what counts as relevant. These decisions happen mostly in the background, embedded in systems and habits rather than explicit choices.</p>

        <p>The attention problem operates on both sides of the organizational boundary. Inside, members need to know what to focus on. Outside, stakeholders need to evaluate organizations whose internal workings they can't directly observe.</p>

        <h2>The Compression Solution</h2>

        <p>Organizations solve the attention problem through compression: they reduce the complexity of the world into a manageable set of considerations.</p>

        <p>Inside the organization, compression happens through routines, roles, and authority structures. A role tells you what to pay attention to and what to ignore. A routine tells you how to respond to familiar situations without recalculating from first principles every time. An authority structure tells you who gets to settle disputes about what matters when people disagree.</p>

        <p>These aren't inefficiencies to be eliminated. They're necessary. Without compression, every decision would require evaluating everything from scratch. Paralysis would be the norm.</p>

        <p>Outside the organization, compression happens through templates and credentials. Investors can't audit every company's operations directly. Regulators can't verify every claim. Customers can't evaluate every product from first principles. So they rely on proxies: certifications, accreditations, governance structures, and compliance with recognized standards. These substitutes for direct verification are what make evaluation possible at scale.</p>

        <p>The compression that happens inside and the compression that happens outside are connected. When an organization adopts a certification or follows an industry standard, it's doing two things at once: making itself easier for outsiders to evaluate and giving its members a shared framework for internal coordination.</p>

        <h2>Where the Power Lives</h2>

        <p>Here's the key insight: the premises that structure attention are where real power resides in organizations.</p>

        <p>Most discussions of organizational power focus on who makes decisions. But that's the surface. Deeper power lies in determining what decisions get made, what information is gathered, what options are considered, and what criteria will be used to choose among them.</p>

        <p>Consider a company deciding whether to enter a new market. The explicit decision might involve analyzing competitive dynamics, financial projections, and strategic fit. But before that analysis begins, someone has already decided what "strategic fit" means. Someone has already determined which competitive dynamics count and which get ignored. The decision premises constrain the decision.</p>

        <p>This is why organizational change is often so difficult. You can reorganize the boxes on the chart. You can hire new people. You can announce new priorities. But if the underlying premises stay the same, the organization will keep producing the same kinds of outputs. The attention architecture is more durable than the formal structure.</p>

        <h2>The Legitimacy Connection</h2>

        <p>Organizations don't choose their premises in isolation. They inherit them from the environments they operate in.</p>

        <p>Consider what happens when a new organization forms. The founders don't invent everything from scratch. They adopt structures that look like what other organizations in their space have. They hire people trained in professional programs that teach particular ways of seeing and categorizing the world. They comply with regulations that specify what must be tracked and reported.</p>

        <p>This isn't weakness or conformity for its own sake. It's practical. Adopting recognized templates makes an organization legible to the people it depends on. A startup that adopts standard governance practices becomes fundable by mainstream investors. A nonprofit that follows established accountability frameworks becomes grant-eligible. A company that implements recognized quality systems becomes a viable supplier.</p>

        <p>Legitimacy templates are compression devices for external audiences. They say: you don't need to verify everything about this organization; you can trust that it meets certain standards because it has adopted recognizable forms.</p>

        <p>But here's the recursive twist: the templates that organizations adopt for legitimacy reasons shape what they actually do. The governance structure you implement to satisfy investors influences what gets measured internally. The compliance framework you adopt to satisfy regulators changes what your employees pay attention to. Form influences substance.</p>

        <h2>The Awareness-Agency Tradeoff</h2>

        <p>Organizations face a fundamental tradeoff between awareness and agency.</p>

        <p>Awareness means keeping options open: noticing more, questioning premises, entertaining alternatives. Agency means committing to act: choosing priorities, stabilizing routines, building coordination around shared premises.</p>

        <p>You can't maximize both. Attending to everything means acting toward nothing. Perfect flexibility means organizational paralysis.</p>

        <p>This is why successful organizations are, in some sense, deliberately blind. They've chosen what not to see in order to be able to act on what they do see. A research lab prioritizes scientific rigor over commercial viability. A private equity firm prioritizes financial returns over employee welfare. A social enterprise prioritizes mission impact over growth rate.</p>

        <p>These aren't compromises or failures to optimize. They're the necessary constraints that make coordinated action possible. An organization that tried to simultaneously maximize scientific rigor, commercial viability, financial returns, employee welfare, mission impact, and growth rate would be paralyzed by premise conflicts.</p>

        <p>The choice of premises is therefore the fundamental strategic choice. Everything else follows.</p>

        <h2>What This Means in Practice</h2>

        <p><strong>On organizational change:</strong> If you want to change what an organization does, change what it pays attention to. New strategies announced from the top will fail if the measurement systems, reporting structures, and role definitions continue to focus attention on the old priorities.</p>

        <p><strong>On coordination failures:</strong> When parts of an organization seem to be working at cross-purposes, check whether they're operating from different premises about what matters. Misalignment often isn't about people disagreeing on goals. It's about people having different default assumptions about what counts as relevant information or acceptable evidence.</p>

        <p><strong>On legitimacy and performance:</strong> The distinction between "looking good" and "being good" is less stable than it appears. Over time, what organizations do to look good shapes what they become. Ceremonial compliance adopted for external audiences gradually becomes embedded in actual practice, for better or worse.</p>

        <p><strong>On institutional persistence:</strong> Templates and standards persist because abandoning them is costly. Even when everyone privately suspects that a particular metric or procedure isn't achieving its stated purpose, switching to something else would require reopening debates about what matters. The attention cost of premise change keeps current practices in place.</p>

        <h2>The Premises Beneath the Premises</h2>

        <p>Organizations are not simply executing strategies. They are running on premises: assumptions about what matters, what counts, and what success looks like that shape everything downstream.</p>

        <p>Those premises are supplied from many sources: professional training, regulatory requirements, industry norms, founding conditions, and the accumulated weight of past decisions. They're stable, often invisible, and deeply consequential.</p>

        <p>The cage remains, as Weber might say. But the bars aren't made of iron. They're made of attention, and of the assumptions that direct it. What we take for granted determines what we can see. What we can see determines what we can do.</p>

        <p>The organizations that navigate this well are the ones that understand they're making a choice, even when the choice feels like inevitability. The question is never just "what should we do?" It's "what should we pay attention to?"—that precedes every other question.</p>
