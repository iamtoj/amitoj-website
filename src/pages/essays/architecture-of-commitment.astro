      <div class="prose prose-lg">
        <p>A university president I know inherited a crisis. National rankings had slipped for five straight years. The previous leadership's response was to revise priorities based on whatever metric dropped most—student selectivity one year, research output the next, alumni giving after that. Each pivot came with new initiatives, new hires, new dashboards. Administrators were exhausted. Nothing improved.</p>

        <p>Her solution seemed counterintuitive: she stopped chasing rankings. Instead, she made one commitment explicit and non-negotiable: students would leave with the ability to think clearly about hard problems. That was locked in. But how to achieve it—pedagogy, requirements, extracurriculars—remained open to constant revision as evidence accumulated about what actually worked.</p>

        <p>The cost of that commitment was real. Locking in "clear thinking" meant saying no to initiatives that would have boosted short-term metrics. A proposed partnership with a certification provider would have increased job placement rates (a ranked metric) but reduced curricular flexibility. A push to increase enrollment would have improved revenue and visibility but diluted the seminar-intensive model that made the thinking happen. Faculty who had built careers around publishable research felt sidelined when the institution stopped rewarding citation counts. Some left. The alumni board, trained to interpret rankings as report cards, needed repeated explanation of why their dollars were being spent on something that couldn't be benchmarked against peer institutions.</p>

        <p>The distinction she drew matters because these two types of decisions require different governance. The commitment to clear thinking should be stable, not revised every time a ranking methodology changes. But the specific methods should adapt constantly as evidence accumulates. Organizations that treat both the same way either drift aimlessly (revising their purposes whenever the numbers dip) or calcify (refusing to update outdated methods because "that's how we do things"). Within four years, her university was climbing again. The difference was not having the right answer, but knowing which questions should stay open and which should stay closed.</p>

        <h2>How Objectives Actually Stabilize</h2>

        <p>If objectives cannot be validated through measurement, what holds them in place? Why do not organizations constantly renegotiate their purposes?</p>

        <p>The answer involves structure, not superior wisdom. In any organization, some positions influence others more than they are influenced in return. A CEO's stated priorities shape what employees attend to more than employee preferences shape the CEO's priorities. This asymmetry is not about the CEO having better knowledge of what the organization should do. It is about their position creating a stable reference point that enables coordinated action.</p>

        <p>A hospital I studied went through three CEOs in five years. Each arrived with different priorities: the first focused on patient experience scores, the second on operational efficiency, the third on community health outcomes. Staff learned to treat each priority as provisional—something to be waited out rather than internalized. Middle managers became skilled at presenting their work in whatever language the current CEO preferred, without actually changing what they did. The organization churned through strategic plans while its actual behavior remained unchanged.</p>

        <p>The fourth CEO understood the problem differently. She spent her first six months not announcing priorities but listening—to board members, physicians, nurses, community partners. Then she made a single commitment: the hospital would reduce preventable readmissions by half within three years. Not because readmissions were the most important metric, but because the commitment was specific enough to coordinate action, stable enough to survive quarterly fluctuations, and connected enough to the hospital's mission that staff could believe it meant something beyond another CEO's hobby horse.</p>

        <p>The commitment held because of how she governed it. Monthly all-hands meetings showed progress on readmission rates—not as a performance review, but as shared information about whether their collective efforts were working. When early data suggested their discharge protocols were ineffective, she changed the protocols publicly, explaining why. When a department head proposed a different metric that would have shown faster improvement, she refused, explaining that switching targets would teach the organization that targets were negotiable. Three years later, readmissions were down 47 percent. More importantly, the organization had learned what it felt like to commit to something and see it through.</p>

        <p>The leader does not need to be right. They need to be stable. Their stability enables others to explore different approaches to achieving the leader's objectives, and that exploration eventually reveals whether those objectives were productive. If outcomes are persistently poor despite good execution, the leader learns from results—not from subordinate pressure—and can revise. But the revision happens through evidence, not through the averaging of opinions that would have destabilized commitment before evidence could accumulate.</p>

        <h2>Ends and Means</h2>

        <p>This points toward a crucial distinction. Some objectives specify what the organization is trying to achieve—these are end-oriented. Others specify how to achieve those ends—these are means-oriented. The distinction determines how objectives should be governed.</p>

        <p>End-oriented objectives express values. "We exist to improve human health." "Our purpose is delivering value to shareholders." "We prioritize sustainable practices." These cannot be verified by measurement because they define what success means rather than describing how to achieve it. They are evaluative commitments, not empirical hypotheses.</p>

        <p>Means-oriented objectives express methods. "We will reduce costs through process automation." "We will increase revenue through geographic expansion." "We will improve safety through standardized protocols." These can be tested against outcomes. If automation does not reduce costs, that is evidence against the method—not necessarily against the underlying commitment to efficiency.</p>

        <p>The governance implication is direct. Means-oriented objectives should be adaptive, revised when evidence suggests they are not working. End-oriented objectives should be stable, revised only when the values they express no longer represent what stakeholders care about. An organization that revises its purpose every quarter is not learning—it is drifting. An organization that never revises its methods is not committed—it is calcified.</p>

        <h2>Three Levels of Architecture</h2>

        <p>This suggests organizations need architecture at multiple levels.</p>

        <p>At the constitutional level, organizations settle foundational questions: Who counts as a stakeholder? Whose interests deserve consideration? What can and cannot be traded off? These questions are fundamentally about values, not effectiveness. A pharmaceutical company that decides patients' interests take precedence over shareholders' when the two conflict has made a constitutional commitment. So has one that decides the opposite. Neither decision can be validated by performance metrics—both are evaluative settlements that shape everything downstream.</p>

        <p>At the institutional level, organizations translate constitutional commitments into priorities. Given that patients matter, which patient interests are most salient? Safety? Access? Affordability? Privacy? Constitutional commitment to patients does not specify how to weigh these competing patient interests. That is institutional work—more revisable than constitutional commitments but more stable than day-to-day operations.</p>

        <p>At the operational level, organizations figure out how to execute. Given that patient safety is the priority, what protocols achieve it? This is where measurement is most useful and where adaptation should be most continuous.</p>

        <p>The architecture determines what kind of feedback revises what kind of objective. Poor quarterly results should trigger operational review—are our methods effective? Persistent poor results despite operational adjustment should trigger institutional review—are our priorities right? Systematic failure to serve stakeholders should trigger constitutional review—do our foundational commitments still reflect what we and our stakeholders value?</p>

        <h2>When Constitutions Conflict</h2>

        <p>The hardest cases arise when constitutional commitments themselves conflict—when an organization discovers that its foundational values are not merely difficult to balance but genuinely incommensurable.</p>

        <p>A community development bank I worked with had two constitutional commitments: serve the financial needs of low-income residents, and maintain the financial sustainability that allows continued service. For years, these coexisted comfortably. Careful underwriting, patient capital, and community knowledge allowed the bank to serve borrowers that mainstream banks rejected while maintaining healthy loan performance.</p>

        <p>Then the housing crisis hit. The choice became stark: continue lending to residents who now faced elevated default risk, or preserve capital by tightening standards in ways that would exclude the people the bank existed to serve. This was not an institutional question about which borrowers to prioritize. It was a constitutional question about whether the bank's purpose was defined by whom it served or by its continued existence as a serving institution.</p>

        <p>There was no algorithm for this. No measurement could adjudicate between "serve the community even if it destroys the institution" and "preserve the institution even if it abandons the community." The bank's leadership eventually chose a middle path—a managed wind-down of the highest-risk portfolio combined with aggressive pursuit of grant capital to absorb expected losses. It worked, barely. But the choice was not derived from their constitutional commitments. It was a political settlement among stakeholders who held those commitments with different intensities.</p>

        <p>Constitutional conflicts expose the limits of architecture. An organization can design governance structures that distinguish ends from means, that stabilize some objectives while keeping others adaptive. But when the ends themselves conflict, structure cannot resolve the tension. The organization faces a choice that its own constitution cannot make: which constitutional commitment takes precedence when both cannot be honored?</p>

        <p>This is not a design failure to be engineered away. It is the condition of having multiple values in a world where they sometimes conflict. The best an organization can do is recognize when it faces a constitutional conflict rather than an institutional or operational one—and understand that resolving it requires political negotiation among stakeholders, not better measurement or clearer procedures.</p>

        <h2>The Strategic Question Shifts</h2>

        <p>This framework changes where strategic choice operates. When measurement was primitive, strategy concerned execution: how do you build an organization that pursues its objectives effectively? That question remains important, but as measurement improves, execution becomes more tractable. Organizations converge on effective practices through observation, imitation, and explicit benchmarking. Competitive advantage from execution erodes as best practices diffuse.</p>

        <p>What remains contested is what the organization should be pursuing in the first place. Which stakeholders to serve, which dimensions of performance to prioritize, which tradeoffs to accept—these are the strategic frontiers as execution becomes commoditized.</p>

        <p>The shift is from "how do we win the game?" to "what game should we be playing?"—and, at the highest level, "how should we structure our ability to change games when this one no longer serves our purposes?"</p>

        <h2>The Design Problem</h2>

        <p>Organizations that have not explicitly distinguished these levels risk two failure modes.</p>

        <p>The first is drift. Without constitutional commitments shielded from ordinary performance feedback, organizations migrate toward whatever their measurement systems make visible. What gets measured gets managed, and what gets managed comes to define purpose—even when no one intended that outcome. Shareholder value became the de facto purpose of many corporations not through explicit commitment but through the drift of attention toward what was most measurable and reportable.</p>

        <p>The second is rigidity. Without operational premises that adapt to evidence, organizations calcify around methods that worked historically but no longer serve current conditions. The commitment to "how we do things" gets confused with the commitment to "what we are trying to achieve."</p>

        <p>Good architecture prevents both by specifying what is stable, what is adaptive, and what mechanisms govern transition between them. Strategic choice then operates on the architecture itself: determining which objectives belong at which level, what triggers revision at each level, and how the organization maintains the capacity to revise its architecture when even its constitutional commitments no longer serve the aims that brought stakeholders together.</p>

        <p>But architecture cannot prevent constitutional conflicts from arising. And when they do, the question shifts from design to politics: not "how should we structure our commitments?" but "who gets to decide when our deepest commitments cannot all be honored?"</p>
