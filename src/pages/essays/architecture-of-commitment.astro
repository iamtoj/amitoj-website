      <div class="prose prose-lg">
        <p>A university president I know inherited a crisis. National rankings had slipped for five straight years. The previous leadership's response was to revise priorities based on whatever metric dropped most—student selectivity one year, research output the next, alumni giving after that. Each pivot came with new initiatives, new hires, new dashboards. Administrators were exhausted. Nothing improved.</p>

        <p>Her solution seemed counterintuitive: she stopped chasing rankings. Instead, she made one commitment explicit and non-negotiable: students would leave with the ability to think clearly about hard problems. That was locked in. But how to achieve it—pedagogy, requirements, extracurriculars—remained open to constant revision as evidence accumulated about what actually worked.</p>

        <p>The distinction matters because these two types of decisions require different governance. The commitment to clear thinking should be stable, not revised every time a ranking methodology changes. But the specific methods should adapt constantly as evidence accumulates. Organizations that treat both the same way either drift aimlessly (revising their purposes whenever the numbers dip) or calcify (refusing to update outdated methods because "that's how we do things"). Within four years, her university was climbing again. The difference was not having the right answer, but knowing which questions should stay open and which should stay closed.</p>

        <h2>The Measurement Paradox</h2>

        <p>As organizations get better at measuring things, a paradox emerges. Better data resolves more questions, but not all questions. Improved measurement makes execution questions tractable. Did the marketing campaign increase sales? Did the new process reduce defects? Did the training program improve retention? With good data, these questions have answers.</p>

        <p>But better measurement does not resolve the question of whether you are measuring the right things in the first place. A university can measure graduation rates with extraordinary precision, but that precision does not tell you whether graduation rates should be prioritized over intellectual depth, or whether either should matter more than student wellbeing.</p>

        <p>This is the measurement paradox: as our ability to track outcomes improves, the question "are we doing things right?" becomes answerable, but the question "are we doing the right things?" becomes more exposed as the contested domain that data cannot settle.</p>

        <p>Climate metrics illustrate the point. Thirty years ago, most organizations could not measure their carbon footprint with any reliability. Both the question "are we reducing emissions effectively?" and the question "should we prioritize emissions reduction?" were bundled together in general uncertainty. Measurement technology has now separated them. We can track emissions precisely, evaluate reduction strategies rigorously, and assign credit or blame for outcomes. But that precision has not resolved whether emissions reduction should rank above shareholder returns, employee wages, or product affordability when they conflict.</p>

        <p>Better data does not resolve what to optimize for—it exposes the choice of what to optimize as the question requiring human judgment.</p>

        <h2>How Objectives Actually Stabilize</h2>

        <p>If objectives cannot be validated through measurement, what holds them in place? Why do not organizations constantly renegotiate their purposes?</p>

        <p>The answer involves structure, not superior wisdom. In any organization, some positions influence others more than they are influenced in return. A CEO's stated priorities shape what employees attend to more than employee preferences shape the CEO's priorities. This asymmetry is not about the CEO having better knowledge of what the organization should do. It is about their position creating a stable reference point that enables coordinated action.</p>

        <p>Think of it like this: when everyone in a room can influence everyone else equally, beliefs converge toward mushy averages that no one firmly holds. Coordinated action becomes difficult because there is no clear focal point. But when some positions are structurally insulated from continuous influence by others, their commitments remain clear enough to give everyone else direction.</p>

        <p>The leader does not need to be right. They need to be stable. Their stability enables others to explore different approaches to achieving the leader's objectives, and that exploration eventually reveals whether those objectives were productive. If outcomes are persistently poor despite good execution, the leader learns from results—not from subordinate pressure—and can revise. But the revision happens through evidence, not through the averaging of opinions that would have destabilized commitment before evidence could accumulate.</p>

        <h2>Ends and Means</h2>

        <p>This points toward a crucial distinction. Some objectives specify what the organization is trying to achieve—these are end-oriented. Others specify how to achieve those ends—these are means-oriented. The distinction determines how objectives should be governed.</p>

        <p>End-oriented objectives express values. "We exist to improve human health." "Our purpose is delivering value to shareholders." "We prioritize sustainable practices." These cannot be verified by measurement because they define what success means rather than describing how to achieve it. They are evaluative commitments, not empirical hypotheses.</p>

        <p>Means-oriented objectives express methods. "We will reduce costs through process automation." "We will increase revenue through geographic expansion." "We will improve safety through standardized protocols." These can be tested against outcomes. If automation does not reduce costs, that is evidence against the method—not necessarily against the underlying commitment to efficiency.</p>

        <p>The governance implication is direct. Means-oriented objectives should be adaptive, revised when evidence suggests they are not working. End-oriented objectives should be stable, revised only when the values they express no longer represent what stakeholders care about. An organization that revises its purpose every quarter is not learning—it is drifting. An organization that never revises its methods is not committed—it is calcified.</p>

        <h2>Three Levels of Architecture</h2>

        <p>This suggests organizations need architecture at multiple levels.</p>

        <p>At the constitutional level, organizations settle foundational questions: Who counts as a stakeholder? Whose interests deserve consideration? What can and cannot be traded off? These questions are fundamentally about values, not effectiveness. A pharmaceutical company that decides patients' interests take precedence over shareholders' when the two conflict has made a constitutional commitment. So has one that decides the opposite. Neither decision can be validated by performance metrics—both are evaluative settlements that shape everything downstream.</p>

        <p>At the institutional level, organizations translate constitutional commitments into priorities. Given that patients matter, which patient interests are most salient? Safety? Access? Affordability? Privacy? Constitutional commitment to patients does not specify how to weigh these competing patient interests. That is institutional work—more revisable than constitutional commitments but more stable than day-to-day operations.</p>

        <p>At the operational level, organizations figure out how to execute. Given that patient safety is the priority, what protocols achieve it? This is where measurement is most useful and where adaptation should be most continuous.</p>

        <p>The architecture determines what kind of feedback revises what kind of objective. Poor quarterly results should trigger operational review—are our methods effective? Persistent poor results despite operational adjustment should trigger institutional review—are our priorities right? Systematic failure to serve stakeholders should trigger constitutional review—do our foundational commitments still reflect what we and our stakeholders value?</p>

        <h2>The Strategic Question Shifts</h2>

        <p>This framework changes where strategic choice operates. When measurement was primitive, strategy concerned execution: how do you build an organization that pursues its objectives effectively? That question remains important, but as measurement improves, execution becomes more tractable. Organizations converge on effective practices through observation, imitation, and explicit benchmarking. Competitive advantage from execution erodes as best practices diffuse.</p>

        <p>What remains contested is what the organization should be pursuing in the first place. Which stakeholders to serve, which dimensions of performance to prioritize, which tradeoffs to accept—these are the strategic frontiers as execution becomes commoditized.</p>

        <p>The shift is from "how do we win the game?" to "what game should we be playing?"—and, at the highest level, "how should we structure our ability to change games when this one no longer serves our purposes?"</p>

        <h2>The Design Problem</h2>

        <p>Organizations that have not explicitly distinguished these levels risk two failure modes.</p>

        <p>The first is drift. Without constitutional commitments shielded from ordinary performance feedback, organizations migrate toward whatever their measurement systems make visible. What gets measured gets managed, and what gets managed comes to define purpose—even when no one intended that outcome. Shareholder value became the de facto purpose of many corporations not through explicit commitment but through the drift of attention toward what was most measurable and reportable.</p>

        <p>The second is rigidity. Without operational premises that adapt to evidence, organizations calcify around methods that worked historically but no longer serve current conditions. The commitment to "how we do things" gets confused with the commitment to "what we are trying to achieve."</p>

        <p>Good architecture prevents both by specifying what is stable, what is adaptive, and what mechanisms govern transition between them. Strategic choice then operates on the architecture itself: determining which objectives belong at which level, what triggers revision at each level, and how the organization maintains the capacity to revise its architecture when even its constitutional commitments no longer serve the aims that brought stakeholders together.</p>

        <p>The question is not merely how to succeed, but what success should mean—and how to preserve the ability to revise that definition when circumstances demand.</p>
