      <div class="prose prose-lg">
        <p>A university president I know inherited a crisis. National rankings had slipped for five straight years. The previous leadership's response was to revise priorities based on whatever metric dropped most—student selectivity one year, research output the next, alumni giving after that. Each pivot came with new initiatives, new hires, new dashboards. Administrators were exhausted. Nothing improved.</p>

        <p>Her solution seemed counterintuitive: she stopped chasing rankings. Instead, she made one commitment explicit and non-negotiable: students would leave with the ability to think clearly about hard problems. That was locked in. But how to achieve it—pedagogy, requirements, extracurriculars—remained open to constant revision as evidence accumulated about what actually worked.</p>

        <p>The cost of that commitment was real. Locking in "clear thinking" meant saying no to initiatives that would have boosted short-term metrics. A proposed partnership with a certification provider would have increased job placement rates (a ranked metric) but reduced curricular flexibility. A push to increase enrollment would have improved revenue and visibility but diluted the seminar-intensive model that made the thinking happen. Faculty who had built careers around publishable research felt sidelined when the institution stopped rewarding citation counts. Some left. The alumni board, trained to interpret rankings as report cards, needed repeated explanation of why their dollars were being spent on something that couldn't be benchmarked against peer institutions.</p>

        <p>The distinction she drew matters because these two types of decisions require different governance. The commitment to clear thinking should be stable, not revised every time a ranking methodology changes. But the specific methods should adapt constantly as evidence accumulates. Organizations that treat both the same way either drift aimlessly (revising their purposes whenever the numbers dip) or calcify (refusing to update outdated methods because "that's how we do things"). Within four years, her university was climbing again. The difference was not having the right answer, but knowing which questions should stay open and which should stay closed.</p>

        <h2>How Objectives Actually Stabilize</h2>

        <p>If objectives cannot be validated through measurement, what holds them in place? Why do not organizations constantly renegotiate their purposes?</p>

        <p>The answer involves structure, not superior wisdom. In any organization, some positions influence others more than they are influenced in return. A CEO's stated priorities shape what employees attend to more than employee preferences shape the CEO's priorities. This asymmetry is not about the CEO having better knowledge of what the organization should do. It is about their position creating a stable reference point that enables coordinated action.</p>

        <p>T-Mobile provides a striking example. For years, the company maintained a single, stable commitment: be the lowest-cost carrier. This wasn't because low prices were the only thing that mattered. It was because that commitment was specific enough to coordinate action across thousands of employees and stable enough to survive quarterly pressure to raise prices slightly and capture more margin.</p>

        <p>The commitment held because leadership governed it consistently. When competitors offered premium pricing for better networks, T-Mobile didn't chase the margin. When analysts questioned why they weren't monetizing their customer base more aggressively, management explained: they were waiting. The strategy required maintaining a price gap until network quality could catch up—at which point they could offer both the best value and the best performance.</p>

        <p>That moment came after the blocked AT&T merger in 2011. T-Mobile received breakup fees and valuable low-band spectrum that dramatically improved their coverage. They had maintained their commitment through years of apparent disadvantage, and now the investment paid off. They could finally deliver on both dimensions of value.</p>

        <p>The leader does not need to be right. They need to be stable. Their stability enables others to explore different approaches to achieving the leader's objectives, and that exploration eventually reveals whether those objectives were productive. If outcomes are persistently poor despite good execution, the leader learns from results—not from subordinate pressure—and can revise. But the revision happens through evidence, not through the averaging of opinions that would have destabilized commitment before evidence could accumulate.</p>

        <h2>Ends and Means</h2>

        <p>This points toward a crucial distinction. Some objectives specify what the organization is trying to achieve—these are end-oriented. Others specify how to achieve those ends—these are means-oriented. The distinction determines how objectives should be governed.</p>

        <p>End-oriented objectives express values. "We exist to improve human health." "Our purpose is delivering value to shareholders." "We prioritize sustainable practices." These cannot be verified by measurement because they define what success means rather than describing how to achieve it. They are evaluative commitments, not empirical hypotheses.</p>

        <p>Chester Barnard made this point forcefully in 1938: "The objective purpose of no organization is profit, but services." Profit may be essential—a necessary condition for continuing to provide inducements to contributors—but it is not the purpose. Organizations that confuse a necessary condition with a purpose lose the ability to distinguish what they are optimizing <em>for</em> from what they are optimizing <em>with</em>.</p>

        <p>Means-oriented objectives express methods. "We will reduce costs through process automation." "We will increase revenue through geographic expansion." "We will improve safety through standardized protocols." These can be tested against outcomes. If automation does not reduce costs, that is evidence against the method—not necessarily against the underlying commitment to efficiency.</p>

        <p>The governance implication is direct. Means-oriented objectives should be adaptive, revised when evidence suggests they are not working. End-oriented objectives should be stable, revised only when the values they express no longer represent what stakeholders care about. An organization that revises its purpose every quarter is not learning—it is drifting. An organization that never revises its methods is not committed—it is calcified.</p>

        <h2>Three Levels of Architecture</h2>

        <p>This suggests organizations need architecture at multiple levels.</p>

        <p>At the constitutional level, organizations settle foundational questions: Who counts as a stakeholder? Whose interests deserve consideration? What can and cannot be traded off? These questions are fundamentally about values, not effectiveness. A pharmaceutical company that decides patients' interests take precedence over shareholders' when the two conflict has made a constitutional commitment. So has one that decides the opposite. Neither decision can be validated by performance metrics—both are evaluative settlements that shape everything downstream.</p>

        <p>At the institutional level, organizations translate constitutional commitments into priorities. Given that patients matter, which patient interests are most salient? Safety? Access? Affordability? Privacy? Constitutional commitment to patients does not specify how to weigh these competing patient interests. That is institutional work—more revisable than constitutional commitments but more stable than day-to-day operations.</p>

        <p>At the operational level, organizations figure out how to execute. Given that patient safety is the priority, what protocols achieve it? This is where measurement is most useful and where adaptation should be most continuous.</p>

        <p>The architecture determines what kind of feedback revises what kind of objective. Poor quarterly results should trigger operational review—are our methods effective? Persistent poor results despite operational adjustment should trigger institutional review—are our priorities right? Systematic failure to serve stakeholders should trigger constitutional review—do our foundational commitments still reflect what we and our stakeholders value?</p>

        <h2>When Constitutions Conflict</h2>

        <p>The hardest cases arise when constitutional commitments themselves conflict—when an organization discovers that its foundational values are not merely difficult to balance but genuinely incommensurable.</p>

        <p>Netflix faced this in 2011 when it split its streaming and DVD businesses into separate services. The company had two constitutional commitments: serve customers with the best entertainment experience, and build a sustainable business that could continue innovating. For years, these coexisted comfortably. The DVD business generated the cash that funded streaming expansion.</p>

        <p>Then the choice became stark. Streaming was clearly the future, but the transition would require cannibalizing the profitable DVD business. Customers who valued the DVD service would feel abandoned. Shareholders who valued current earnings would see them decline. This was not an institutional question about pricing or packaging. It was a constitutional question about whether Netflix's purpose was defined by serving current customers' preferences or by building the company that could serve future customers best.</p>

        <p>There was no algorithm for this. No measurement could adjudicate between "preserve what customers currently value" and "build what they will value tomorrow." Netflix chose to split the services and raise prices. The stock dropped 77%. Customers canceled in droves. Critics declared the company had destroyed itself through arrogance.</p>

        <p>But leadership held the commitment. They had decided that their constitutional purpose was building the future of entertainment, not preserving the current model—even at enormous short-term cost to shareholders and customers. Years later, the decision proved correct. The DVD business was a melting ice cube. By sacrificing near-term commitment to shareholders, they built the dominant streaming platform.</p>

        <p>Constitutional conflicts expose the limits of architecture. An organization can design governance structures that distinguish ends from means, that stabilize some objectives while keeping others adaptive. But when the ends themselves conflict, structure cannot resolve the tension. The organization faces a choice that its own constitution cannot make: which constitutional commitment takes precedence when both cannot be honored?</p>

        <p>This is not a design failure to be engineered away. It is the condition of having multiple values in a world where they sometimes conflict. The best an organization can do is recognize when it faces a constitutional conflict rather than an institutional or operational one—and understand that resolving it requires political negotiation among stakeholders, not better measurement or clearer procedures.</p>

        <h2>The Strategic Question Shifts</h2>

        <p>This framework changes where strategic choice operates. When measurement was primitive, strategy concerned execution: how do you build an organization that pursues its objectives effectively? That question remains important, but as measurement improves, execution becomes more tractable. Organizations converge on effective practices through observation, imitation, and explicit benchmarking. Competitive advantage from execution erodes as best practices diffuse.</p>

        <p>What remains contested is what the organization should be pursuing in the first place. Which stakeholders to serve, which dimensions of performance to prioritize, which tradeoffs to accept—these are the strategic frontiers as execution becomes commoditized.</p>

        <p>The shift is from "how do we win the game?" to "what game should we be playing?"—and, at the highest level, "how should we structure our ability to change games when this one no longer serves our purposes?"</p>

        <h2>The Design Problem</h2>

        <p>Organizations that have not explicitly distinguished these levels risk two failure modes.</p>

        <p>The first is drift. Without constitutional commitments shielded from ordinary performance feedback, organizations migrate toward whatever their measurement systems make visible. What gets measured gets managed, and what gets managed comes to define purpose—even when no one intended that outcome. Shareholder value became the de facto purpose of many corporations not through explicit commitment but through the drift of attention toward what was most measurable and reportable.</p>

        <p>The second is rigidity. Without operational premises that adapt to evidence, organizations calcify around methods that worked historically but no longer serve current conditions. The commitment to "how we do things" gets confused with the commitment to "what we are trying to achieve."</p>

        <p>Good architecture prevents both by specifying what is stable, what is adaptive, and what mechanisms govern transition between them. Strategic choice then operates on the architecture itself: determining which objectives belong at which level, what triggers revision at each level, and how the organization maintains the capacity to revise its architecture when even its constitutional commitments no longer serve the aims that brought stakeholders together.</p>

        <p>But architecture cannot prevent constitutional conflicts from arising. And when they do, the question shifts from design to politics: not "how should we structure our commitments?" but "who gets to decide when our deepest commitments cannot all be honored?"</p>
