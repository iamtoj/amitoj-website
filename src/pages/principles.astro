      <p class="text-lg text-ink-light mb-6">
        I think clearly when I separate three things: <strong>what matters</strong>, <strong>what's true</strong>, and <strong>what I'm willing to do about it</strong>. I think most, if not all, of my personal and professional frictions comes from mixing up these questions and overestimating how clear the answers are.

    <div class="max-w-2xl">
      <div class="space-y-12">

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">First: Values set direction. Evidence sets method.</h2>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            "Should we?" is an evaluative question. It can't be solved by more data.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            "Can we?" is an epistemic question. It <em>can</em> be solved&mdash;slowly, imperfectly&mdash;by experiments, measurement, and iteration.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">So I try to route decisions accordingly:</p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-ink-light space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Route "should" upward</strong> (to values, identity, responsibility).</li>
            <li><strong>Route "can" downward</strong> (to practice, prototypes, tests, and feedback).</li>
          </ul>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">From there: Capabilities are discovered, not declared.</h2>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            I don't trust self-images&mdash;mine or anyone else's.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            "I can do X" is a <strong>scientific claim</strong>: it becomes real through repeated attempts under stated conditions, with honest accounting of failures.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            Constraints matter (failure teaches), but I try to orient around <strong>capability creation</strong>: expanding what I can reliably do, not just shrinking what I avoid.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">Then: Codify what works.</h2>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            When something is repeatedly true, I compress it:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-ink-light mb-4 space-y-2">
            <li>into a <strong>principle</strong> when it requires judgment,</li>
            <li>into a <strong>system</strong> when it can be made deterministic.</li>
          </ul>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            This is how knowledge becomes leverage: fewer decisions require fresh willpower every time.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">But always: Protect what matters from what's measurable.</h2>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Metrics are useful, but they're not neutral.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            What's visible tends to become "real," and what's "real" tends to start running the show. I try to keep slow, non-measurable commitments (care, integrity, meaning) from getting colonized by fast proxies.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h2 class="text-2xl mb-6">Therefore: Earn autonomy. Don't gamble for it.</h2>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            More freedom should come from more validated capability and tighter feedback loops&mdash;not from pretending risk is virtue.
          </p>

      <p class="text-ink-light mb-8">
        A simple mapping I return to:
      </p>

      <div class="space-y-8">
        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">Naam Japna &mdash; humility (epistemic honesty)</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Humility is the beginning of science.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            It's the stance that says: <em>I might be wrong; reality gets a vote; my model is not the world.</em>
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            Practically: keep a log, look for disconfirming evidence, update without drama.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">Kirat Karna &mdash; hard work (experimentation)</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Knowledge is built, not wished into existence.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Hard work is running the trials: prototypes, reps, iterations, measurements.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            Practically: choose a method, do the work, repeat until the signal is real.
          </p>
        </div>

        <div>
          <h3 class="text-xl mb-4 text-sage-700">Vandh Chakna &mdash; sharing (replication + diffusion)</h3>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            A result that can't be shared isn't stable knowledge&mdash;it's personal luck.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light mb-4">
            Sharing is how claims become communal: others can test them, extend them, and build on them.
          </p>
          <p class="text-ink-light">
            Practically: publish the artifact, teach the method, share the credit.
          </p>

        </p>
      </div>

      <p class="text-ink-light mt-8">
        That's the kind of "science" I care about: not just explanations, but durable, transferable capability&mdash;grounded in values and accountable to reality.
